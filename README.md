# Java Thread Demo

This Java program demonstrates basic thread creation and manipulation using a simple menu-driven console interface.

## Overview

The program allows users to perform the following actions:

1. Create and start a new thread.
2. Check if a thread is alive.
3. Get the priority of a thread.
4. Set the priority of a thread.
5. Exit the program.

## How to Use

1. Compile the Java source file (`ThreadDemo.java`) using a Java compiler.

2. Run the compiled program.

3. Follow the prompts in the menu to perform desired actions.

## File Structure

- `ThreadDemo.java`: Contains the main program logic including the menu system and thread manipulation.
- `MyThread.java`: Defines the custom `MyThread` class which extends `Thread` and represents individual threads.

## Additional Notes

- Error handling is implemented to handle invalid inputs and edge cases.
- The program provides basic functionality and can be extended for more advanced use cases.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!
